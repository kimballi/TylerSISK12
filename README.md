TylerSISK12
===========
Collection of queries I use to update and pull information from SISK12 through the database.   

Use these queries at your own risk!  You have a test system - please try these there first if you are unsure how they will work. 

All my queries are written to be run with the database selected - not from master.   

This allows you to easily switch from SDMRTrain to SDMRT to run the query. 

Please run the CreateAuditTable before running any of the update scripts to track your changes. 

Feel free to contact me with questions.
